# Python Development (Under Development) :sweat_smile:

Here are some of my Python development. Feel free to check them. I am still learning the language so if you have tips and advices for me,
send them.

Thank you! :blush:


### BlackJack
Play BlackJack using Python. You can use any IDE as you want. Have fun!

```python
.------.            _     _            _    _            _    
|A_  _ |.          | |   | |          | |  (_)          | |

      |  \/ K|                            _/ |                
      `------'                           |__/           
```
What is the game about?
> In blackjack, the goal is to have a hand total that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21. Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" to receive another card or "stand" to keep their current hand. The dealer then reveals their cards and hits until their hand reaches 17 or higher. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose, and if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, they win. A hand with an Ace and a 10-value card is called a blackjack and pays out at a higher rate.


### Kaggle Challenge - The Optimized Exhibition Opening
> This problem statement describes an art exhibition organization task in which paintings need to be arranged to satisfy robotic attendees. Here's the breakdown of requirements:
Task:
•	Arrange paintings in a large corridor where the robots will view them.
Considerations:
•	The attendees are robots with specific tastes.
•	Robots view each painting as a simple list of tags representing elements of the painting.
•	Robots distinguish between two types of paintings: Landscape (horizontal) and Portrait (vertical).
•	Each frameglass can contain either one Landscape painting or two Portrait paintings.
•	The list of tags for a frameglass is the same as that of the painting(s) it contains.
•	You are given a dataset with all information about the set of paintings.
